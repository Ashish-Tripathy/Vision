## What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?

<b>Ans.</b> A set of distinguishable features together form an image. Multiple features can represent similar aspect of the image. Consider the example of Chicken Biryani. To prepare Chicken Biryani we need lots of different ingredients like Turmeric, Red chilly powder, salt, Chicken pieces, tomato, onion, green chillies, garllic etc. All these ingredients can be grouped under logical groups like Vegetables, Chicken pieces, Masala powders. So these groups having similar ingredients can be thought of as channels with resect to image. So basically a Channel is a bag or container of similar features.
