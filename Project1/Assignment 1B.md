<b>Vertical Edge Detector
With the already provided code for vertical edge detector I noticed that all the edges were not coming up, like the first line of the 'H' was not coming up and only the  second line was showing. So I followed a rudimentary idea of just keeping the middle pixel as largel values so it does not cancel the entire convoluted matrix sum and give some positive values for all sort of vertical edges.
